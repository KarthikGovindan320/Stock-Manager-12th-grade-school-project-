1) Latest version of python with pip enabled
2) A stable internet connection, throughout the usage of the program
3) Any private database with its desegnated url, db name, password, which have to be updated accordingly in the code. (I use phpmyadmin online database with a dedicated url, but localhost would be fine)
4) Default file writing permission on your operating system

Any problems with the program might be due to one or more of these prerequisites are not met. Contact me for any help on the same
