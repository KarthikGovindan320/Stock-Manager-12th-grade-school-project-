# Stock Manager - 12th Grade School Project

## Overview
This project aims to address the challenges of stock management in schools and institutions.  
Managing stock manually with paper and pen often leads to inefficiencies, errors and endless frustration, so I set out to create a simple, userfriendly digital solution to ease the transition.

To understand the real-world needs, I consulted with a member of my school's lab stock administrative team and gathered insights on the expectations and challenges they face.

## Features
- **Detailed Stock Logs**:  
  Maintains comprehensive records of all stock items, categorized by:
  - Departments
  - Branches
  - Offices

- **Stock Status Tracking**:
  - Tracks items that are:
    - Lent out
    - Donated
    - Damaged
    - Repaired
  - Records the monetary value of each item.

- **Responsibility Management**:
  - Keeps track of which staff members are responsible for which stock items.
  - Ensures that faculties can manage only the stock directly under their department's control.

## Planned Improvements
- Add a dedicated window to manage:
  - Fines for late returns
  - Fines for damaged equipment
- Implement special administrative controls for department heads.

This is a Python-based stock management project hosted on GitHub.  
The goal is to create an easy, efficient alternative to traditional stock tracking methods.
